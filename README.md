***I like this video because even though I have spent a decent part of my life around snakes, I have never seen anything like this before. The way this snake's scales reflect light, and just the fact that I have never seen something like this is what amazes me. That is why this video is interesting to me.***

### Favorite Quote

> In peace nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility; but when the blast of war blows in our ears, then imitate the action of the tiger; stiffen the sinews, disguise fair nature with hard favored rage. . .
– William Shakespeare (“Quote from King Henry V”)
